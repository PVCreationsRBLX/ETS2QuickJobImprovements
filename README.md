# ETS2 Quick Job Improvements

Euro Truck Simulator 2’s Quick Job truck pool has seen better days. A lot has changed since the game first launched in 2012, but lately SCS seems to have neglected this part of the game. Quick Jobs are not only a great source of income in earlier stages of the game, but they are also great for trying out new trucks before fully committing to them. SCS has since introduced new features like the Used Truck Dealer, but Quick Jobs are still great if you simply want to test drive a truck.

Some heavy-haul configurations of the New Generation DAFs have inspired me to create this mod. There are two, and they’re both 4×2. A single rear axle should not be doomed to bear so much weight, hence why I originally named this mod 4×2 ¡NO! back in early 2024. I originally abandoned the project because I didn’t know what I was doing, but I was motivated to resume it due to the glaring opportunities SCS missed when updating the DAFs.

This mod aims to fix these longstanding issues – and then some. It also introduces more configurations to some of the game’s dealerships, remediating a growing lack of diversity – albeit in part.

Even if you don’t use Quick Jobs, I hope you enjoy using this mod. If you have questions or need to report an issue, you may do so on the PV Creations Discord server.
